# EDA: Fast Food Nutrition

## Problem
My project addresses a significant concern within the student community at William and Mary regarding the transition from mandatory meal plans to optional ones starting in the junior year. This shift often leads to increased reliance on fast food options among students, raising questions about the nutritional and financial implications compared to the university meal plan. My project aims to provide clarity on these matters by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional and financial disparities between meal plan offerings and commonly chosen fast food items. Additionally, the project will delve into the variations among fast food establishments, shedding light on the diverse choices available and their respective impacts.

## Questions
- Which fast food restaurant near William and Maryâ€™s campus offers the most nutritious and well balanced food?

## Data Source
-  I decided to scrape fastfoodnutrition.org personally to ensure I was able to obtain all the information I needed.
