# FastFood v. Campus Meal Plan

My project addresses a significant concern within the student community at William and Mary regarding the transition from mandatory meal plans to optional ones starting in the junior year. This shift often leads to increased reliance on fast food options among students, raising questions about the nutritional and financial implications compared to the university meal plan. My project aims to provide clarity on these matters by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional and financial disparities between meal plan offerings and commonly chosen fast food items. Additionally, the project will delve into the variations among fast food establishments, shedding light on the diverse choices available and their respective impacts. By undertaking this investigation, the project seeks to equip students with tangible insights into the decision-making process surrounding meal plans versus fast food, ultimately facilitating more informed choices regarding their dietary and financial well-being during their academic journey.
